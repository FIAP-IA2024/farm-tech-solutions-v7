# Dataset Organization

## Description

Organize a dataset with a minimum of 40 images of Object A and 40 images of Object B (distinct from Object A), totaling at least 80 images. This dataset will be used for training, validating, and testing a computer vision model using YOLO.

## Instructions

1. Select two distinct objects (A and B) to be detected by the computer vision system
2. Collect at least 40 high-quality images for each object
3. Ensure images have good lighting and are taken from various angles
4. Verify all images are in compatible formats (JPG, PNG)
5. Review the existing dataset in `PROJECT_ROOT/data` to confirm it meets the requirements

## Validation Criteria

- At least 40 images for Object A
- At least 40 images for Object B
- Images are of good quality and suitable for computer vision tasks

## Status

- [x] Completed
