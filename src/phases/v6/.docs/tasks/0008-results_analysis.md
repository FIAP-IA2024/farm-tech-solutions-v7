# Results Analysis and Comparison

## Description

Analyze and compare the results from different training configurations to evaluate model performance and document findings in the Jupyter notebook.

## Instructions

1. Load and analyze results from both training configurations (30 epochs vs 60 epochs)
2. Create comparative visualizations for key metrics:
   - Training/validation loss curves
   - Precision/recall curves
   - Confusion matrices
   - mAP progression over epochs
3. Analyze and document the following:
   - Impact of increasing epochs on model accuracy
   - Signs of overfitting or underfitting
   - Optimal epoch number based on validation metrics
   - Trade-offs between training time and performance gains
4. Document all findings in markdown cells within the notebook
5. Formulate clear conclusions about which configuration performs better and why

## Validation Criteria

- Comprehensive analysis of training results from both configurations
- Well-organized visualizations comparing key metrics
- Clear explanations in markdown cells documenting insights and conclusions
- Sound reasoning for recommended configuration

## Status

- [x] Completed
