# YOLO Model Training

## Description

Train the YOLO model using the prepared dataset to create a computer vision system capable of detecting Object A and Object B. This is the core of the project.

## Instructions

1. Set up the YOLOv5 environment and clone the repository if working locally
2. Configure the YOLOv5 model for your specific dataset:
   - Create a dataset YAML file with class names and paths to train/val/test directories
   - Select an appropriate model size (YOLOv5s, YOLOv5m, YOLOv5l, or YOLOv5x)
3. Configure training parameters:
   - Batch size
   - Image size
   - Number of epochs
   - Learning rate
4. Execute the training process
5. Monitor training progress:
   - Loss metrics
   - Precision, recall, and mAP
   - GPU utilization and training speed

## Validation Criteria

- Model training completes successfully without errors
- Training metrics (loss, mAP) show improvement over time
- Model weights are properly saved
- Training logs and charts are saved for analysis

## Status

- [x] Completed
