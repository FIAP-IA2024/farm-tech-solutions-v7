# Jupyter Notebook Setup

## Description

Set up a Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab environment to train, validate, and test the YOLO model. This will serve as the main environment for our computer vision implementation.

## Instructions

1. Create a new Jupyter Notebook named with the following format: `[FullName]_[RM]_pbl_fase6.ipynb`
2. Set up the notebook with appropriate sections:
   - Introduction and project overview
   - Environment setup and dependencies
   - Data loading and preprocessing
   - Model configuration
   - Training section
   - Validation section
   - Testing section
   - Results analysis and comparison
   - Conclusion
3. Install and import required libraries:
   - YOLOv5 dependencies
   - PyTorch
   - OpenCV
   - Matplotlib for visualization
   - Other necessary packages

## Validation Criteria

- Notebook has correct naming format
- All required sections are properly structured
- Required libraries are successfully installed and imported
- Code cells are interspersed with markdown cells for clear documentation

## Status

- [ ] Completed
